# Minerva

A chat-bot system that learns a representation of a user's knowledge for more effective communication

## Setup

Create a local virtual environment with Python 3.10 (can be done by running `python3.10 -m venv [your-venv-name]`). Activate your virtual environment and install the requirements from `requirements.txt`. Define environment variable called `LLAMA3_PATH` pointing to your downloaded model (doesn't necessarily have to be Llama3).
