COMP_SCI 312-0 Data Privacy (1 Unit)  


Data breaches, privacy breaches, and concerns about algorithmic decision-making have been on the rise. As a result, data privacy has become an increasingly significant concern in the past several years. Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality. The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice. We will study concepts such as differential privacy, database anonymization, anonymous communication, and algorithmic fairness. We will also discuss privacy in the context of web privacy, social network privacy, human factors, and machine learning along with any policy implications.

COMP_SCI 322-0 Compiler Construction (1 Unit)  


The compiler is the programmer's primary tool. Understanding the compiler is therefore critical for programmers, even if they never build one. Furthermore, many design techniques that emerged in the context of compilers are useful for a range of other application areas. This course introduces students to the essential elements of building a compiler: parsing, context-sensitive property checking, code linearization, register allocation, etc. To take this course, students are expected to already understand how programming languages behave, to a fairly detailed degree. The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.


Prerequisite: COMP_SCI 213-0 or consent of instructor.


COMP_SCI 323-0 Code Analysis and Transformation (1 Unit)  


Fast, highly sophisticated code analysis and code transformation tools are essential for modern software development. Before releasing its mobile apps, Facebook submits them to a tool called Infer that finds bugs by static analysis, i.e., without even having to run the code, and guides developers in fixing them. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox analyze and optimize JavaScript code to make browsers acceptably responsive. Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture since hardware relies on software to realize its potential. In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of code analysis and transformation, and you will apply them by extending LLVM, a compiler framework now in production use by Apple, Adobe, Intel and other industrial and academic enterprises.


Prerequisite: COMP_SCI 213-0.


COMP_SCI 324-0 Dynamics of Programming Languages (1 Unit)  


The goal of this course is to introduce you to the semantics of programming languages (PLs). While CS 321 explains the meaning for different PL features, such as store and control, through interpreters, this course gives them meaning using simple math. And by simple, I mean as simple as high-school algebra. Hence, the course will help you build a foundational understanding of PLs by breaking them down to their most basic ingredients without having to go through PLAI or another meta language. In other words, the course will teach you how to construct mathematical models of PLs. Moreover, because of their mathematical and foundational nature, these models will enable you to describe precisely properties of PLs that in CS 321 we only talked about in an intuitive manner.

In addition, we encourage students to participate in the UCSB International Capture the Flag Competition. Capture the Flag is a network security exercise where the goal is to exploit other machines while defending your own. In fact, this course should prepare you for any one of many capture the flag competitions that take place year-round. We will learn about different types of hacks and perform them. After learning how to execute such exploits and penetrate a network, we will discuss ways to protect a network from others exploiting the same vulnerabilities.
